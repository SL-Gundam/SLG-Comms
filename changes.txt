v2.2.0
- Fixed a problem with html characters in the dropdown box "Default server" in the admin settings page and install page.
- Merged 2 savecache functions, one for teamspeak (functions.ts.inc.php) and one for ventrilo (functions.vent.inc.php), to one function within functions.inc.php.
- Added some extra protection against characters in the server data retrieved from ventrilo and teamspeak servers which could contain sql injection code.
- Added a new function to the MySQL and MySQLi classes called "escape_string".
- Added extra protection to the exec function used by ventrilo.inc.php.
- Added a check whether the Ventrilo status program file you selected exists (only applicable for the admin settings page, this has not been implemented in the install page). It doesn't check whether its the right file though.

- Fixed a comment glitch for clients within ventrilo channels with html special characters.

- Added a Setting that enabled the ability to show or hide the Processing time stuff at the bottom of the pages.
- Changed the TeamSpeak provider info to be more resistant against spam engines looking for email addresses.
