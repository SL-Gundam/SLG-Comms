- Updated the Apache1.3 PHP5 bug tester concerning the "apache_get_modules" function
- Updated code as far as possible to be up2date for PHP5 deprecated items, but still retaining PHP4 compatibility. If you run PHP 5.0.0 till 5.1.2 SLG Comms will have deprecated items (var $variable; calls) in PHP 5.1.3 and higher these were no longer deprecated ( They removed the notice at least ).
- A whole bunch of language fixes.
- Updated the ip:port checker
- Renamed the db class from "db" to "database" due to SLG Comms using the same name ("db") to use the class ("$db = new db;" is now "$db = new database;").

- Updated the bug checker to check for open MySQL connections

- Fixed problem with the table prefix not being properly used sometimes in install.php.
- Settings that are of no use to people who want to use the "NO_DATABASE" mode will not see them anymore. Before these settings were grayed out.
- Added a dump of all open GLOBAL variables to the end of the script in case DEBUG is enabled. This code will be commented out in the releases because even you enable DEBUG a dump of the variables should be enabled only when you really want that

- Improved readability of the "English" Language files.
- Fixed a small problem with the vBulletin 3.5 forum profile
- EXPERIMENTAL IPv6 support added. The ventrilo_status program probably doesn't support this yet though, the fsockopen thats used to connect to TeamSpeak servers does support it but i'm not sure the TeamSpeak server program itself supports it yet. TeamSpeak 3 probably will support IPv6 though but that would definitly require a new version of SLG Comms.
- SLG Comms now clears variables sooner when they are no longer needed. This has been done so that the more memory intensive actions cause less problems.
- Required PHP version changed to PHP 4.2.0 ( PHP 4.2.0 was already required if you were running SLG Comms with the old MySQL 3.23.xx extension. In other cases the minimum would have been PHP 4.1.0 ).

- Template class improved. Performance improved slightly.
- Ventrilo error handling has been improved.
- Added the fsockopen function to the requirement list while installing SLG Comms.
- Improved errors displayed during retrieval of livedata for TeamSpeak and Ventrilo servers.
- Fixed a bug in the TeamSpeak server data parser.

- To free memory as fast as possible "while array_shift" has been used in favor of "foreach" while looping through channels and clients
- Made hyperlinks of the resource names on the "administrator -> Manage resources" and "administrator -> Manage servers" pages so that you can easily go to the specific TeamSpeak or Ventrilo server when you click on it.
- Updated formattime function to support years. Weeks and Months will not be added. Weeks is not really necessary and months is not possible with the current structure as its length is not the same every single time. 1 Year = 31556926 seconds according to google's "seconds in a year"
- Added TeamSpeak fsockopen stream timeout checks. These only work for PHP 4.3.0 of higher.
- Added checks in Database classes whether the received parameters were really what they should be.
- The retrieval of live server data and its managements is now completely done from a class to improve performance and ease of use.
- Various code optimizations
- Changed global variable calls from functions from "global $var;" to "$GLOBALS['var'];"
- Improved the update messages of the "administrator -> Resource cache" (Now called "Manage servers") page to resemble the udate messages of the "administrator -> settings" page.
- During live server updates of cached server data, simultaneous requests will now use cached data instead of also trying to retrieve live server data. (Only applicable when caching is enabled)
- If live server updates of cached server data fails, SLG Comms will not immediatly try again. It will return cached server data for 30 seconds before trying again. (Only applicable when caching is enabled).
- A maximum of failed consecutive connection attempts has been added. When 25 consecutive connection attempts failed to a specific server the server will no longer update his data. To fix this you have to click on the exclamation mark in front of the server on the "Manage servers" page in the administrator section.
- Changed all include() functions to require() functions (same for the _once versions of these functions)
- Modified the layout of SQL error messages a bit
- Fixed a glitch with the fsockopen (used for TeamSpeak server connections) errors returned by PHP.

- Optimized several parts of the Live data retrieval process and improved its error handling
- Optimized several parts of the rawdata processing part
- Changed uasort functions to usort functions as this might save a bit performance and memory wise.
- SLG Comms now displays a proper error when fsockopen is disabled in php.ini
- Fixed a bug in the processing of the TeamSpeak server data where certain characters were removed when they shouldn't be.
- Fixed a bug in the parsing of TeamSpeak server data when tabs were present in certain names. Tabs will be removed from strings because they can screw up the layout of the pages.
- Fixed Opera compatiblity issue concerning the css class "error" and "error2" and its usage (This class was not used in the templates so thats why its not a change in the templates, also the style class itself wasn't changed. What was changed was the way it was used)
- Updated the error handling system to support sequential errors in a nicer way.
- Changed the way the prep_tooltip function works. Now htmlentities is applied seperately so that prep_tooltip can be called on the whole tooltip
- Added a version conflict check to detect whether the installed version has the right files that belong to that version.
- Some of the form variable names used by SLG Comms caused problems when the apache module "mod_security" (http://www.modsecurity.org/) was used and the Default rules were applied. This has now been fixed and SLG Comms will now stay completely within the boundaries of those rules.
- Removed the unused icons from images/ts/ directory
- Changed all the TeamSpeak icons to TeamSpeak icons i found zipped on a website. These icons are better looking and show whether a channel is locked or not.
- Increased the amount of allowed servers within the database from 255 to 65535
- Added 2 new settings, namely: Base_url and Root_path. Base_url is used to link images and stylesheets in safer way in the template. Root_path serves the same purpose only then for require, include, exec, checkfilelock and file_get_content functions. So Base_url is from a clientside point of view and Root_path is from a serverside point of view.
- TeamSpeak rights will now be calculated during the processing of the raw server data.
- Added protection against eternal looping in recursive functions.
- Proper translation name will now be displayed for settings being updated in the Administrator interface
- Added a new setting which allows you to remove the ping behind in the name of clients in the channel information pane. This was added so that the new template for Content Management Systems has some more free space if disable this setting

- Added sticky to the TeamSpeak client tooltip
- Adjusted parameters for the link to edit resources
- Changed the name of the primary key field in the cache table.
- Applied a fix to the DB::MYSQL database profile which used a function from PHP4.3 while SLG Comms should not go beyond PHP 4.1 or 4.2 depending on the installation type. SLG Comms now requires PHP4.2 for all installation types
- Enhanced the sorting of TeamSpeak channels and clients a tiny bit.
- Removed the encode_ip and decode_ip functions and replaced them with simple MD5's

v2.2.4
- Added XOOPS 2.2.3 Final + CBB 2.32 support. You are required to place SLG Comms in a sub directory of xoops, the name doesn't matter so you can even create a new directory. This is because XOOPS has a protection against scripts outside of the XOOPS root directory.
- Fixed a problem with the configuration file downloading during installation.
- Fixed a problem when certain information is missing from the ventrilo server data. (v2.3.0+ of the ventrilo server allows the hiding of selective data). A message will be displayed if channel and / or client data is missing (Comment data excluded).
