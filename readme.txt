Just run install.php. It will guide you through the process

Because the ventrilo status program is copyright protected i can't pack it into this release. Please download a version of the Ventrilo server from www.ventrilo.com and place the "ventrilo_status.exe" (Win32 executable) and / or "ventrilo_status" (Unix / Linux executable) in a folder accessible by SLG. make sure that the files have full rights especially under Unix / Linux. It requires read, write and execute (777) access. Quite possibly you could also use the files for other operating systems allthough this has not been tested.

At the moment i can't think of anything that should go mayorly wrong and you wouldn't get a good error. If you do stumple upon problems which you don't understand please go to http://slg.sourceforge.net. Click on "project" and then on Bugs. Please fill in your problem there.

on a side note: The difference with the 2 templates delivered with this package is very small. The only difference is how the admin menu is setup. More of an example if anyone ever wants to create his or her own templates for SLG.

I'd like to thank the men and women who made Emule (www.emule-project.net) because the web interface they created gave me good ideas for some enhancements to the script.
